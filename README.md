# Collisions

Vector based collision detection system developed in `pygame` for python 2.7

## Usage

All code required is in the vector_collisions class file. You can easily convert from `pygame` to `Cocos2d` by replacing the .rect[] commands with location.x and location.y. All the rest of the code for the class is independant of the library used.

Example usage can be found in Collision_test.py
